## Project 2: Traffic Sign Recognition

### Overview

This project creates and trains a deep convolutional neural network from scratch, with the task of classifying German traffic signs using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The trained model is subsequently tested on German traffic signs found on the web, as well as US traffic signs.

### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)
- [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

### Dataset

This project uses the German Traffic Sign Dataset. A pickled version that has images resized to 32x32 is available [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580d53ce_traffic-sign-data/traffic-sign-data.zip). The pickle file was used as the raw data for this project.

For dataset augmentation, run `python data_aug.py`

### How to run

You can step through the Jupyter Notebook at `Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb`, or you can read the HTML export of the notebook at `Traffic_Signs_Recognition.html`.

If you want to run the model training and prediction on sample images, in a stand-alone script, run `python traffic_signs.py`.

### Pre-trained model
The model I have trained is saved in `model.ckpt`, as a TensorFlow model.
